# Memory Block Visualization

In this project, I tried a graphical application for visualizing memory allocation.
It uses PyQt5 for the visulatation and numpy for data which are taking from user.

## Features

- **Memory State Colors**: 
   - Green for used memory blocks 
   - yellow for free blocks, and 
   - red for blocks requested by the user.


## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python or Python3 installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   you have to downlode numpy and PyQt Python libraries.
   pip install numpy
   pip install pyqt5 (I use this cause this version in compatable for Mac OS)
   

## How to Run


1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the application:
   python main.py

The application will launch, and you can interact with the memory blocks through the GUI.

## Notes

- This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate memory allocation concepts visually.
- Feel free to modify and expand upon the code for further experimentation.
